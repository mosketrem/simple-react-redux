This is a simple ReactJS application using Redux feature. Don't consider it as an example. It was done just as a study project.

For now it can only keep its state in a Redux store and reset the state.

Things left to do:
- add routing (the state variables are copied to the url in a browser)
- rewrite the entire app to TypeScrip (now it's in ES6)
- add ability to recreate the state from the url
