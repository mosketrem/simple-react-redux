This is a simple ReactJS application using Redux feature. Don't consider it as an example. It was done just as a study project.

It can:
- keep its state in a Redux store and reset the state.
- copy the state variables to the url in a browser. Every state is stored into the browser's history.
- recreat the state from the url when loading the page.

Things left to do:
- rewrite the entire app to TypeScrip (currently it's in ES6)
